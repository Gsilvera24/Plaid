## Overview and Origin

The company was funded in May 2013 by Zach Perret (right) and William Hockey (left).

Perret and Hockey began their careers at Bain Consulting. While at the company, they noticed that the financial system and many of their components were outdated and inefficient. They both started working on side projects and eventually left the company to join startups. In the process, they built an app called Rambler which let users track their bank transactions on a map layout. They quickly realized that extracting data from banks was particularly difficult which led them to focus on building the infrastructure that would facilitate these issues. This was the lightbulb moment for them and as a result Plaid was born. Instead of working on the app, they worked on the backend technology that allows them to extract bank data from users in real time. In late 2013, they started their seed funding at  $2.8 million from Spark Capital. By the time they had reached their Series C funding, they had landed a $44 million round from Goldman Sachs investment partners. 

## Plaidâ€™s Business Activities:

* Plaid is the technological infrastructure that allows fintechs to communicate with banks in real time. Before Plaid, banks and third party applications would use micro-transactions and written confirmations in order authenticate transactions. Plaid uses the login credentials from consumers to connect directly to their bank accounts. They can extract key information like balances or recent transactions without risking any other information like personal information or account numbers. 

* The company's intended customers are other fintechs or any company that deals with some kind of financial transaction, mainly payments. Plaid is not a SaaS (software as a service), it is a platform that is mostly embedded in the code of other fintech companies. The regular consumer does not directly interact with the platform. In fact, Plaid is currently the backend infrastructure for many large fintech companies, Venmo, Betterment, TrueBill, Samsung, Chime and many others. Consumers use it everyday and may not even realize. Market size is virtually unlimited at the moment since there are so many fintechs popping up.


* The technology behind Plaid is an API (application programming interface). Getting started with the Plaid API does not take very long and all the details can be found at their [Github repository](https://github.com/plaid/quickstart)

## Landscape:

* Plaid is essentially a financial services company. As mentioned before, the company is not Saas but instead offers a platform where transactions can be performed. The company makes money not from their infrastructure by itself, but through the amount of transactions it handles. Plaid charges by tier depending on transaction volume. 

* Financial services in fintech vary widely. The key aspect that sets Plaid apart is their back end infrastructure. Companies like Venmo do not have to worry about the code they need in order to run smooth transactions. Plaid handles this for them. Venmo now just worries about expanding their consumer base. This is good for Plaid because they will be able to handle more transaction volume if Venmo expands. If their partner is doing well, so will they. 

* There are few other players in the space; Galileo Financial Technologies, Akoya, Finicity, SynapseFI, MX, N26, Codat, Xignite and Varo Money. Most of these do not have the kind of market share as Plaid.

## Results

* The impact Plaid has had over the fintech space is tremendous. As of April 2021, the company is valued at $13 billion. More and more fintech apps are adopting their payment infrastructure. It is a key component in the fintech space.

* The metrics that are used involve the volume of transactions that pass through the platform.
